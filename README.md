# Autonomous-Robot (Applicatio of Embedded systems)
The Project is construction of an autonomous robot that finds its destination itself and avoids obstacles with the DoRoBo board based on an Atmel2560 micro-controller with FreeRTOS.

Implemented concurrent behavior based strategy of an autonomous mobile robot based on touch sensors, IR sensors and the micro-controller.

I have used,
* 2x Sharp ir-distance sensors
* 2x micro switches
* 2x remote control receiver sensors
* 1x chassis with three motors, 
to program and optimize Robot behavior.
